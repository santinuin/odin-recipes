    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These burger patties are made with ground beef and an easy bread crumb mixture. Nothing beats a simple hamburger
        on a warm summer evening. Pile these burgers with your favorite condiments and pop open a cool drink!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your
            hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
        <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
